# Dev Diary

My name is Dusan and Dev Diary is my side project which I will use to document my developer journey. 
I want to document everything that I learn and use this is my personal diary but also to share my knowledge with others.

## About me

As I said my name is Dusan, I've started programming in 2018 and I haven't made any big brakes in my programming journey since. 

I am interested in backend development, dev ops, lowlevel programming and embedded systems. Currently I only know some basics about dev ops and lowlevel programming but I am going to learn that and document the journey on this blog, so if you are interested this is the place for you, feel free to contact me and have a chat.
